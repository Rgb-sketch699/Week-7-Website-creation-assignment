    <h2>About our Republic Commando's:</h2>
    <p>Our Republic Commando troops were first created on Kamino and are the best Clone Troopers we've grown by far. </p>

    <h2>Why choose Republic Commando's?</h2>
    <p>They have the highest quality strength, accuracy, armaments and suit technology out of any CLone Trooper we've grown and deployed over the past 10 years.</p>
    <h5>They can singlehandedly bring a platoon of clankers to ruin as well as put up a considerable fight against Droideka's as you can see.</h5>
